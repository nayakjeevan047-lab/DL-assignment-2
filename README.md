Deep Learning Models: CNN, RNN Variants, and GAN
This project implements and evaluates several deep learning architectures across different machine learning tasks. The objective is to study how different neural network models perform on image classification, sequence learning, and generative modeling problems.

The project was developed as part of a Deep Learning coursework assignment.

Models Implemented
1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
A custom CNN architecture was implemented for image classification on the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
The model includes convolutional layers, ReLU activations, batch normalization, max pooling, and dropout regularization.

2. Transfer Learning (ResNet18)
A pretrained ResNet18 model was used for comparison with the custom CNN.
The model was adapted for grayscale Fashion-MNIST images and the final classification layer was retrained for the task.

3. Recurrent Neural Networks for Text Classification
Three sequence models were implemented using TensorFlow/Keras:

Simple RNN
LSTM
GRU
These models were trained on the IMDB movie review dataset to perform binary sentiment classification.

4. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
A GAN was implemented to generate synthetic Fashion-MNIST images.

The model consists of:

Generator

Generates images from random noise
Discriminator

Distinguishes between real images and generated images
